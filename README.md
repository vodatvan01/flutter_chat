# Installing Firebase CLI Guide

Firebase Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful tool for managing your Firebase projects through the command line. Below is a guide on how to install the Firebase CLI on your computer.

## Step 1: Install Node.js and npm

Firebase CLI is built on the Node.js platform and uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage software packages. If you haven't installed Node.js and npm, you can follow these steps:

1. Visit the official Node.js website at [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Download and install the appropriate version of Node.js for your operating system.
3. Once the installation is complete, open a terminal window or command prompt and run the following commands to check the installed version of Node.js and npm:

   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

## Step 2: Install Firebase CLI

After you have installed Node.js and npm, you can proceed to install the Firebase CLI with the following steps:

1. Open a terminal window or command prompt on your computer.
2. Run the following command to install Firebase CLI:

   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

   This command will globally install Firebase CLI on your system, allowing you to use the `firebase` command from anywhere on your computer.

3. Wait for the installation process to complete.

## Step 3: Verify the Installation

To verify if Firebase CLI has been successfully installed, you can run the following command:

```bash
firebase --version
```

If you see the current version of Firebase CLI, it indicates that the installation was successful.

## Step 4: Log into Firebase CLI

After installing Firebase CLI, you need to log into your Firebase account to use the features related to your projects. Follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to log in:

   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

3. A browser will open for you to log in to your Firebase account. After successful login, return to the terminal window to continue using Firebase CLI.

Congratulations! Firebase CLI has been installed, and you have successfully logged in. Now you can use it to manage your Firebase projects through the command line.
